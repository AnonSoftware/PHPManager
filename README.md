# PHPManager
Simple php based custom website


Ever used Wordpress but wanted to make your own site with more customisation well PHPManager is the solution.

PHPManager uses a module based system in order to allow for fully customised websites.




 **How it works
 
 PHPManager Modules utalise simple mehanics such as Regex and a Hook based system to call extra functions
 
 The regex system(ModuleVar) uses regex sysntax to search a target page and replace any matches with a return from the designated function
